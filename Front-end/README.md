Certainly! It seems like you have a `titan-watch` project with React and Vite. Here are the steps to set up your project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using git clone

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server, and you can access your app at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Step 4: Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build your project for production. The output will be in the `dist` directory.

### Step 5: Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command will run ESLint to check for and fix linting issues in your project.

### Step 6: Preview the Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

This command will preview the production build locally. It's useful for testing your app as it will behave in a production environment.

### Step 7: Start Developing

Now you're all set up! Start developing your React app with Vite by editing files in the `src` directory. Customize your components, create new pages, and build your Titan Watch app!
